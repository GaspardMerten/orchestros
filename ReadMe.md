# Orchestros

## A Graphical ARGOS Arena Editor Tool

Orchestros is a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) developed using Unity, which simplifies the process of
creating ARGOS files for swarm robot simulations. The GUI enables users to easily design and configure various elements,
such as walls, cylinders, and polygons, within the ARGOS arena.

## Installation

To use Orchestros, begin by visiting the release page of this repository and downloading the latest version. Currently,
it is compatible with Windows, Linux, and Web platforms.

## Features

Orchestros provides a user-friendly interface for creating ARGOS files. It offers an intuitive drag-and-drop system for
creating or modifying Argos arenas. With just a few clicks, users can add walls, polygons, cylinders, and perform
actions like copy-pasting and more.

## Usage

Once you have downloaded the latest version of Orchestros, you can begin using it by opening the executable file. 

To display commands, press `H` on your keyboard.

The system's only aspect that may seem less intuitive is the ability to create a `.orchestros/template.argos` file in the root folder of your user. This file serves as a template for all new arenas. In case you don't create this file, the default template will be utilized.
